# Airline-System-Website
## Node js Express project 
### General
In this project I used my Node Js and Express knoledges to create a website for my fictional airline company named UAirlines


### Getting started
install Node Js, Express and EJS to your machine <br/>
cd to the root directory of the project and then to the 'airlineSystem' folder
type 'node app.js' to start server
go to hhtp://localhost:7000

### Main server file

app.js

### HTML pages
All the HTML pages are in the airlineSystem/views directory. These are ejs files which call partials in ejs to include html in other pages.

### Static files (Image, CSS)
All the images and style.css are in the airlineSystem/public directory

### DB files 
Main file - airlineSystem/airline.db where I loaded tables from sql files /airlineSystem/users.sql, /airlineSystem/transactions.sql, /airlineSystem/prices.sql

## Warning
Front-end works correctly when your page is 100% scale
