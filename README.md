# Airline-System-Website
## Node js Express project 

### Getting started
install Node Js, Express and EJS to your machine


### General
In this project I used my Node Js and Express knoledges to create a website for my fictional airline company named UAirlines

## Warning
Front-end works correctly when your page is 100% scale

### Fucntionality
When you open main page you can sign up or log in if you already have an account. After, app creates a record for your account in the sqlite3 database, you can create transaction by choosing where you want to fly, whereof you want to fly. Then app creates a record to the database's table 'transaction'.

After that you can log out, delete the acc, change email and password etc.
